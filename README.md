# Sports Scheduler

## Overview
The Sports Scheduler is a web application that allows administrators to manage available sports and enables players to create and join sport sessions. The project follows an agile development approach, where features are defined as user stories for different personas.

## Features

   - Admins can create sports by providing a name.
   - Admins can view a list of sports they have created.
   
2. **Create Sport Sessions:**
   - Admins can create sport sessions like regular players.
   - Admins can join sessions they create.
   
3. **View Reports:**
   - Admins can access reports showing the number of sessions played in a configurable time period.
   - Admins can analyze the popularity of different sports based on participation.

### Player Features

   - Players cannot join past sessions.
   - Sessions joined by a player are displayed separately from available sessions.

4. **Cancel Created Sessions:**
   - Players who created a session can cancel it by providing a reason.
   - The cancellation reason is visible to all users who had joined the session.
   - Canceled sessions are marked distinctly in the playerâ€™s session list.

### Optional Features
